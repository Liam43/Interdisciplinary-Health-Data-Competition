## Interdisciplinary Health Data Competition
### Project Introduction
In the Spring of 2020, I had the opporunity to compete in the first University of Minnesota's [Interdisciplinary Health Data Competition.](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/health-data-competition?fbclid=IwAR0foNkWPUXqJEMhUNhHtqJcPVDDV5edGg6ZUDWNARXOW20xh-t6JaP24r0) I recruited a team consisting of my classmates and medical students, and though my team did not advance to the final rounds, it was still a good learning experience. The data we had provided a good look into the world of pharmaceuticals and drug prescriptions.

Most of our work was done in Google Drive and Hangouts, and I'm writing this GitHub as a project retrospective. In this repository, I'll be talking through our project's process as we navigated through the project and our findings we used to make our recommendations. You can find the high level summary in our Final Presentation Powerpoint.


### Datasets and Data Cleaning
The data we used came from the Minnesota Department of Health's All Payer Claims Database. The data came in the form of two spreadsheets: Prescription Summary and Drug Detail. We ran into difficulties almost immediately.
