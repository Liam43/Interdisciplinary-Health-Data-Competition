## Interdisciplinary Health Data Competition
### Project Introduction
In the Spring of 2020, I had the opporunity to compete in the first University of Minnesota's [Interdisciplinary Health Data Competition.](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/health-data-competition?fbclid=IwAR0foNkWPUXqJEMhUNhHtqJcPVDDV5edGg6ZUDWNARXOW20xh-t6JaP24r0) I recruited a team consisting of my classmates and medical students. Though my team did not advance to the final rounds, it was a good learning


### The Project's Dataset
The data we used came from the Minnesota Department of Health's All Payer Claims Database.
